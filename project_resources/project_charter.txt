---Problem Statement---
There is a need for an embedded file system which can maintain integrity on flash storage, in the event of power faults and fluctuations. There are transaction-based file systems that meet this need, however they do not offer an interface for encryption.

---Project Objectives---
-Create a functional file system
-Is suitable for running on an embedded system
-Optimized for flash storage
-Supports both NOR and NAND flash
-Wraps a currently maintained open-source file system
-Makes minimal changes to it to allow easy integration of upstream fixes
-Transaction based
-Presents an interface for user-defined file encryption
-Presents an interface for user-defined filename obfuscation

---Stakeholders---
-Developers – Brian Vervaet, Max Molnar, Wyatt Dahlenburg, Zach Kent, Samuel Spencer
-Development Managers – Keewhan Park
-Project Owners – Jonathan Elchison (Cyber Software Engineer, Northrop Grumman Xetron)
-Users/Customers – Northrop Grumman Xetron

---Deliverables---
-A file system that meets all of the objectives listed
-An interface for defining encryption
-An interface for filename obfuscation
-Delivered on an embedded system

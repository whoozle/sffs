permissions setup:
each file has an owner and a permissions byte
last two bits of the permissions byte specify read and write permissions of users that are not the owner, and the 2 bits before those specify read and write permissions of the owner 
Default permissions (14):
****rwr-
meaning that the owner can read and write to the file, but any other user can only read it

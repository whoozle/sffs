Problem Statement
Power faults and fluctuations lead to poor integrity on flash storage. XFFS will be used as a filesystem that is fault-tolerant, atomic, and encryptable to prevent data failures and maintain security on flash storage and harddrives.


Background Information
Many devices use Flash storage for persistent storage. In situations where power fluctuates (batteries running out, power outages, pulling the plug), the integrity of these Flash- based file systems can be compromised, rendering the device degraded or useless. This problem is often solved by utilizing a transaction-based file system, in which write operations are atomic. However, no such file system exists today that also provides an interface for user-defined encryption.

	* As a user, I would like dependable data in the event of power failure
	* As a admin, I would like to maintain permissions of files
	* As an admin, I would like to define encryption for all write and read operations to the filesystem
	* As an admin, I would like to define a hash for all filenames to be obfuscated

  Non-Functional Requirements:
	We must be able to implement this on many different devices.
	The encryption interface should work quickly.
	The system willbe embedded
	The interface should be user friendly

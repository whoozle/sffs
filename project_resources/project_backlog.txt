Problem Statement:
There is a need for an embedded file system which can maintain integrity on flash storage, in the event of power faults and
fluctuations. There are transaction-based file systems that meet this need, however they do not offer an interface for encryption.


Background Information:

Many embedded devices use Flash storage for persistent storage. In situations where power fluctuates (batteries running out,
power outages, pulling the plug), the integrity of these Flash- based file systems can be compromised, rendering the embedded
device degraded or useless. This problem is often solved by utilizing a transaction-based file system, in which write operations
are atomic. However, no such file system exists today that also provides an interface for user- defined encryption.
